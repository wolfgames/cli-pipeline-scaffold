# Modules Index

Reusable building blocks + assembled prefabs. Can import from `core/`. Never imports from `game/`.

**Before creating a new visual component, check this catalog.** If something here matches your intent, use it — don't rebuild from raw Pixi objects.

## Primitives

Single-purpose, configurable components. No deps on other modules. All extend `PixiRenderable`.

| Module | What it does | Use when you need… | Path |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------|

| screen-flash | Full-screen flash-and-recover overlay | match clears, power-ups, hit flash, damage flash | primitives/screen-flash/ |
| hud-display | Labeled text group for game stats | score, level, moves, timer, combo, any HUD values | primitives/hud-display/ |
| tile-grid | 2D grid of colored cells with labels | match-3 boards, puzzle grids, color grids, tile games | primitives/tile-grid/ |

## Logic

Pure logic, no rendering. Factory functions configured by game code.

| Module | What it does | Use when you need… | Path |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|------|
| level-completion | State machine: playing → completing → complete | tracking level/round lifecycle | logic/level-completion/ |
| progress | Save/load progress backed by localStorage | persisting player progression | logic/progress/ |
| catalog | Ordered content catalog with navigation | chapter/level selection, content sequencing | logic/catalog/ |
| loader | Fetch + transform content pipeline | loading level data, configs, remote content | logic/loader/ |
| evidence-tracker | Found/unfound tracking per scene with active clue rotation | hidden object found/unfound state, clue management | logic/evidence-tracker/ |
| hint-system | Cooldowns with exponential growth, count, targeting | hint cooldowns, progressive hints, targeting | logic/hint-system/ |
| popup-queue | FIFO queue with timing, stacking limit, priority | sequential popups, toast queues, notification stacking | logic/popup-queue/ |
| scene-navigation | Unlocked scenes, current scene, transitions | multi-scene navigation, scene unlock progression | logic/scene-navigation/ |

## Prefabs

Assembled from primitives + logic. Higher-level building blocks.

| Module | What it composes | Use when you need… | Path |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|------|
| avatar-popup | Circular avatar + dialogue + show/dismiss | character speech, notification popups, tooltips | prefabs/avatar-popup/ |
| popup | Toast-slide wrapper with auto-dismiss | toast notifications, timed alerts | prefabs/popup/ |

| options-menu | Sprite-button menu with toggles/sliders | settings menus, in-game options | prefabs/options-menu/ |
| companion-character | CharacterSprite + slideIn/popIn/exit/dance presets | tutorial hosts, narrative companions, celebration characters | prefabs/companion-character/ |
| announcement-overlay | Backdrop + headline + content slots + action button | chapter intros, chapter overlays, level complete screens, story beats, interstitials, any full-screen announcement | prefabs/announcement-overlay/ |
| evidence-list | Scrollable scene-thumbnail list with found/unfound states | hidden object evidence panels, collectible lists | prefabs/evidence-list/ |
| score-popup | Commendation badge + star rating celebratory reveal | end-of-level celebrations, score reveals | prefabs/score-popup/ |
| scene-renderer | Scene sprite + hotspots + ambilight composition | hidden object scenes, interactive environments | prefabs/scene-renderer/ |
| search-objects-panel | Evidence list + progress bar + hint button | hidden object HUD, search game sidebars | prefabs/search-objects-panel/ |

## Module Structure

Every module follows this shape:

```
modules/<category>/<module-name>/
  index.ts          ← public API (barrel export)
  defaults.ts       ← extracted magic numbers
  tuning.ts         ← panel schema for Tweakpane
  renderers/        ← renderer-specific implementations (visual modules only)
    pixi.ts           ← Pixi.js implementation
```

Logic modules use factory functions instead of renderers:

```
modules/logic/<module-name>/
  index.ts          ← factory function + types + public API
  defaults.ts       ← default config values
  tuning.ts         ← panel schema for Tweakpane
```

## Where to put new modules

- Single-purpose visual component → `primitives/`
- Pure logic, no rendering → `logic/`
- Assembles multiple primitives → `prefabs/`
- Reusable across games? It belongs here. Game-specific? It goes in `game/`.
